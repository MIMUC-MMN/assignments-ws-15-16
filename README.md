# assignments-ws-15-16
Collaborative repository for the online multimedia assignments at the University of Munich (LMU) in the winter semester 2015/2016.
We only tackle the assignments for the major subject students (Hauptfach) here. 

## Goals and Rationales ##
- We do not offer sample solutions. Instead, we want you to work together to come up with a creative 
solution that everyone can live with.
- Sample solutions are always problematic, because it is too difficult to write code that a) is error-free b) everyone can understand, and c) everyone agrees with. 
In most cases, there is a different way to solve a problem. We do not propose a certain solution. Instead, you should discuss your own solutions with each other.
- The code we collect here is also a great way for students in future semesters to become inspired. 

## How to contribute ##
There are multiple ways to contribute to this repository. However, you are required to sign up for a free GitHub account. 

1. You can [**fork**](https://github.com/MIMUC-MMN/assignments-ws-15-16#fork-destination-box) the repository by clicking the button on the top right that says fork. 
This is a very handy solution, if you want to keep a personal repository and work there. However, you need to create
pull requests if you want your code to appear in the main repository here. 

2. You can join the [**students-15-16**](https://github.com/orgs/MIMUC-MMN/teams/students-ws-15-16) team and push directly to the repository. It is crucial that you follow the code
 of conduct.
 
Make sure to add your work in the correct folder, e.g. a01. 

## Code of Conduct ##
1. Do not commit code, that generates error messages.  
2. By committing you agree to have your code published on GitHub.
3. If someone changes one of your solutions, don't be mad and discuss the reasons for the change.
4. Do not ridicule or mock other people's code. Improve it, and diligently explain what you did and why you did it.
5. Do not push binaries, libraries, or external code, unless absolutely necessary. You are responsible for respecting intellectual property.
