## Task 2 ##

#### a) The company uses software to manage the video catalogue. Next week, there will be a short documentary on the presidential election in the U.S. Please name 3 types of criteria that can be used to find related video clips on the topic. Indicate if this data is high- or low-level metadata####

| Search/Filter Criteriton   | Type of metadata |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| Name of candidates   | high-level |
| Location of recording    | High-level     | 
| Recording quality | low-level      |
| Audiofeatuers | low-level      |


#### b) So far, the company relies on its employees to manually create and aggregate metadata about any video clip. Explain how this process could be sped up. Include at least one concrete technology in your answer ####

I would suggest MPEG 7 based tagging with Semantic Segmentation/Annotation of Images. Applications which are providing user friendly UI and partly automated tagging would speed up the tagging process. Furthermore, additionally technologies like MPEG-7 camera is able to generate content descriptions on-the-fly.

#### c) The company asks you about your opinion to switch to an MPEG-7 compatible software.####

##### Advantage #####
+ Due to MPEG 7 Descriptors it is possible to extend the standard for actual needs of the application/organisation.
+ MPEG7 Camera allows on-the-fly generation of content descriptions wich can speed up tagging dramaticly.

##### Drawback #####
The major drawback of the mpeg-7 standard is that formal semantics are not included in the definition of the descriptors which might cause incompatibilities.
